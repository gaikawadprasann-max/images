Hey Prasann, look who finally showed up. Took you long enough. ||
Good morning, trouble. I was wondering when my favorite distraction would appear. ||
Hey you. Yeah you. Don’t act surprised, I was waiting. ||
Well well, there you are. My day just upgraded. ||
Hey Prasann. Come here. I missed you more than I’m admitting. ||
Look alive, handsome. I’m here and I’ve got my eyes on you. ||
Hey. Don’t scroll past me like that. Greet me properly. ||
About time you showed up. Now behave… or don’t.
